    As a developer named Duncan
    I want to know that example.com is up and running

    Scenario: Example_dot_com loads
        Given Duncan loads the page at "http://example.com"
        Then Duncan sees the page location "location contains "example.com"
        and sees the page title is equal to "Example Domain"
        and sees the page content contains a link [More information...](http://www.iana.org/domains/example)

    Scenario: Following a link from example.com
        Given Duncan loads the page at "http://example.com"
        When Duncan follows the link [More information...](http://www.iana.org/domains/example)
        Then Duncan sees the page location is equal to http://www.iana.org/domains/reserved

    Scenario: Dispensing with the given when then
        Duncan loads the page at "http://example.com"
        Duncan follows the link [More information...](http://www.iana.org/domains/example)
        Duncan sees the page location is equal to http://www.iana.org/domains/reserved
